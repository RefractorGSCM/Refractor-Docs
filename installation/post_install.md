# After Install

If your deployment of Refractor was successful, you should see a login screen when you navigate to your domain name. If you see this, congratulations! Refractor was deployed successfully.

Take a look at the sections below to learn what to do next.

## First Login

Remember the username and email address you entered for the initial user account in the quickstart installer? Check your email for a welcome email which will allow you to set your password.

Once you've set your password, you should be redirected to a page telling you to verify your email. Check your email once again, this time for a verification email. Click the link and your email address will be verified. You will then be redirected to the Refractor dashboard.

**If you didn't receive an email to set your password**, then use the "forgot your password" link on the login page to reset it.

## Adding Your First Server

Click on the "Servers" tab to view the server list. You should be prompted to add a server.

Select the correct game, enter a name and the server's RCON credentials and then click "Add Server". If this was successful, the modal should close. Once this happens, reload the page and you should see your server in the list. If the RCON information provided was correct, the watchdog will automatically establish connection to your server in a moment.

Congratulations! Refractor is now moderating your first server. If you have other servers in your community, you can add them using the same method.
