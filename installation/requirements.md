# Requirements

Refractor is a self-hosted web application. You will require a domain name and a server you can run Refractor on. The server doesn't need to be very powerful. Something like a basic cloud VPS (virtual private server) with 1 CPU and 512 MB memory should work fine. Refractor records are small and don't require much storage space.

For Linux systems with low amounts of memory (under 2GB), it is recommended that you set up a page file to make the installation a bit quicker. The steps to do this will differ depending on what operating system you're using.

Refractor was built for and tested on Linux. It is currently unknown whether or not it works properly on Windows machines.
