# Infraction Event Commands

Refractor can run configurable commands on your servers for the following infraction events: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `repeal`.

These commands can be configured by super admin users by navigating to `Admin Settings > Games` and selecting the game whose commands you want to configure.
