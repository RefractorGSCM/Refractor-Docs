![Groups page](/images/groups_page.png)

Refractor has support for user groups. You can get to the group management page by navigating to `Admin Settings > Groups`.

In the image above, you will see a group titled Everyone. This is the base group. It cannot be renamed or deleted, but it's color and permissions can be changed.

You should also see a "New Group" button. Click this button to begin creating a new group.

## Creating Groups

Once you've clicked New Group, the right pane should open up the group management screen. here, you may name the group, set it's display color and manage it's permissions.

When you're done, hit Save and the group will be created.

See the [Permissions Overview](/users/permissions?id=permissions-overview) page for more information on permissions.

## Group Order

You can re-order groups by dragging them up or down in the list. The base group (Everyone) always has to be on the bottom.

This only has cosmetic effects. If a user has multiple groups, the color of the user's highest positioned group will be used as the user's name color.
