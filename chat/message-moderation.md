# Flagged Message Moderation

The Message Moderation page is accessible with the `Flagged Messages` link in the sidebar.

This page is only accessible to users with the `Moderate Flagged Messages` permission. As this permission can be overridden on servers, only flagged messages belonging to servers on which the user has this permission will be shown.

Upon being presented with a flagged message, users have two options. They can choose to either **Unflag** the message or **Moderate** it.

If the user clicks on Unflag, the message gets unflagged and the user is presented with the next flagged message.

If the user clicks on the Moderate button, a modal with a list of moderation actions available to the user will be presented (e.g logging warnings, bans, etc). Upon logging an infraction, that infraction will be linked to the chat message. The chat message will be shown to anyone who views this infraction record in the future. The message will then be unflagged and the user will be shown the next flagged message.

> Unflagging messages should be used when a message does not break your community's rules, or when not enough context is available to justify a moderation action.
