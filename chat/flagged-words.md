# Flagged Words

Flagged words are case-insensitive words set by administrators which when detected in a chat message cause that chat message to be flagged. These flagged messages can then be reviewed by users.

Admins can view the flagged words settings page by navigating to `Admin Settings > Flagged Words`.
